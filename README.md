# CS565 Survey

This is the website that was used to collect feedback in order to gather data for the paper 'The Impact of Design Representation 
on the Feedback'. How do designers usually get feedback? How do different design representations affect feedback online? 

## Preliminary Study
Interview designers about how they represent their design process. How often do they share their work online in hope of feedback and what their expectaions are from that feedback.

Process : Seeked out designers on the following platforms -> AMT, Reddit, Facebook and Personal Connections.
Based on this, we divided ways of design representation for feedback in 4 broad categories.
* Final Design
* Ideation and Final Design
* Variations and Final Design
* Full Design Process

## Gathering Data
Based on the above categories, we manually curated and categorized top 1000 recent designs from Reddit and Behance.

## Experiment
We came up with a design and used the four representation methods described above and used various online sources such as reddit, behance, dribbble, facebook and other personal sources to gather feedback. We used the likert scale to rate the usefulness of the feedback. Two raters rated the responses individually, blind to others' rating. Based on this data, we came up with the paper.
